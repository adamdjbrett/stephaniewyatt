Stephanie Wyatt earned her Ph.D. in the area of Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) from <a title="Brite Divinity School at TCU - Home Page" href="http://brite.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brite Divinity School</a> in Ft Worth, TX. Her dissertation is <em>Widows in the Memories of Biblical Israel.</em> A life-long Baptist and an ordained minister, she is passionate about biblical interpretation, Christian education, social justice, living sustainably, and healthy, yet delicious food. In her spare time Stephanie enjoys spending time with her significant other, Adam, participating in worship planning for her church, trying local restaurants, listening to folk, jazz, and blues, and aerobic dancing (Zumba). In beginning the job search process, she is looking for a position teaching undergraduates or seminary students how to be thoughtful citizens and sensitive biblical interpreters. Originally hailing from East Tennessee, she misses the mountains and Grainger County tomatoes, but enjoys exploring the fantastic art museums in Dallas/Ft Worth. Currently Stephanie resides in Syracuse, New York.
